Gary: So, can I use [fx type="wave"]GDScript with YarnSpinner?!!!![/fx]  #my_metadata #line:02fa0cd 
Derrick: Many features can be used with GDScript. For example, you can make a custom presenter like the one in this scene. #line:09c1c2c 
Derrick: You can also interact with DialogueRunner and variable storage nodes with cross-language scripting. #line:0b086af 
Derrick: And you can also write commands in GDScript by using AddCommandHandlerCallable. Your GDScript commands can even use 'await'. Look! #line:0c22e97
